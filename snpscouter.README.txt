#OVERVIEW
The purpose of the SNPscouter is to find SNPs (small nucleotide polymorphisms)  
within the context given to the scouter by input files. SNPscouter connects to a
SQLite database which contains data for non-synonomous SNPs with at least one   
population having a minor allele frequency of at least 1%. This data is mostly  
derived from the 1000 Genmome Project and tracks the frequency of alleles within
5 populations: East Asia (EAS), Europe (EUR), Africa (AFR), Americas (AMR), and 
South Asia (SAS).


#RUN IT
Again, the information that is queried from the database and returned is based  
on the context of the information given. That context is decided by the user at 
runtime based on the input files given to SNPscouter. Thus, the SNPs returned   
can be filtered to more specific groups. These are in the input/filter options: 

1. No filter: Returns all SNPs in the database. Only input required is the data-
   base (.db) file. Can be run as such:
	user@host > SNPscouter.py -d db_filepath [OPT: -o output_prefix]
2. Filter to only SNPs in genes associated with ELISAs. Input the database file 
   and a .txt file with a list of genes:
	user@host > SNPscouter.py -d db_filepath -e elisa_filepath [OPT: -o     
	output_prefix]
3. Filter SNPs which are in both a list of ELISA and a fasta file:
	user@host > SNPscouter.py -d db_filepath -e elisa_filepath -f fasta     
	_filepath [OPT: -o output_prefix]
4. The full scope of SNPscouter is to return SNPs which lie within in peptides  
   from genes for which an ELISA exists. A fasta file is also used to place each
   peptides within the context of its protein:
	user@host > SNPscouter.py -d db_filepath -e elisa_filepath -f fasta     
	_filepath -p peptides_filepath [OPT: -o output_prefix]

For your convenience, some testfiles for ELISA, peptides, and fasta files are   
included in the "testfiles" folder. The SNP database can be found at "db files\ 
SNP.db".


#OUTPUT
Running the program results in 3 different output files, each using the output  
prefix option (or "RENAME" if no output prefix is given). These are based on out
-put criteria that I was asked to use. Each has a threshold that someday might  
be an option but for now is set at 10%. The criteria and outputs are:

1. "*.global.txt" file only includes SNPs (post-filtering) with a global minor  
   allele frequency (MAF) greater than 10%
2. "*.variance.txt" file only includes SNPs where there is variance of more than
   10% between two populations
3. "*.jon.txt" (for Jon Jacobs), includes only SNPs where any population has a  
   MAF greater than 10%
